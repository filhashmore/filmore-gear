## About

FILMORE Gear Inventory is built for touring production managers and backline techs working with the band FILMORE. It replaces spreadsheet-based gear tracking with a mobile-friendly, dark-themed interface optimized for backstage and venue use. The app supports DRIVE shows (full trailer), FLY shows (airline baggage limits), and Storage classification. It includes role-based approval workflows where PMs submit acquisition requests for management/artist approval.

## Key Features

- **Inventory Tracking**: Status (Good, Maintenance, Damaged, Unknown), show type (DRIVE, FLY, Storage), pack location, per-owner views
- **Acquisitions Workflow**: PM submits → Management/Artist approves or denies, with rent vs own, pricing, and product links
- **FLY Pack Management**: Visual crew-member cards showing checked bags and carry-ons, with search highlighting
- **Consumables Tracking**: Stock levels, reorder status, direct purchase links
- **Sortable Columns**: Click column headers to sort ascending/descending
- **Color-Coded Badges**: Show types, pack locations, statuses, and categories all color-coded
- **PWA Support**: Add to home screen on mobile for app-clip experience with iOS safe area support
- **Reduced Motion**: Respects prefers-reduced-motion for accessibility
